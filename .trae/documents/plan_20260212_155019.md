I will remove all hardcoded currency and monetary values, replacing them with relative "Effort/Investment Levels" and focusing on measuring performance metrics (Attendance, Reach, Engagement).

### **1. Update Simulation Logic (`src/store/useSimulationStore.ts`)**
*   **Remove:** `monthlyBudget` (currency value), `projectedRevenue` (currency value), `ROI` (financial).
*   **Add/Replace with:** `investmentLevel` (0-100 scale).
*   **Logic Change:** 
    *   `investmentLevel` drives the "Paid Reach" and "Production Quality" factors.
    *   Outputs will focus on **Attendance**, **Brand Awareness Score**, and **Digital Reach**.
    *   "Profit/Revenue" charts will be replaced with "Impact/Engagement" charts.

### **2. Refine Scenarios Page (`src/app/scenarios/page.tsx`)**
*   **Remove Prices:** Delete "€500", "€1,500", etc.
*   **Rename:** Scenarios will be defined by "Resource Allocation" (Low, Medium, High).
*   **Sliders:**
    *   Replace "Monthly Budget (€)" with "**Investment Intensity**" (Scale 1-10).
    *   Keep "Events Per Month" and "Posts Per Week" as they are tangible metrics.
*   **Visuals:** Update cards to emphasize *strategy* (e.g., "Organic Focus" vs "Aggressive Expansion") rather than price tiers.

### **3. Update Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**
*   **Remove:** Revenue/Cost/Profit charts.
*   **Add:** 
    *   **"Brand Impact vs Effort"**: A chart showing how increased investment correlates with brand strength.
    *   **"Attendance Stability"**: Visualizing how consistent events lead to stable attendance (vs sporadic spikes).
*   **Metrics:** Show "Total Reach", "Avg Attendance", "Engagement Rate".

### **4. Update Content & Events Pages**
*   **Content Page:** Remove "€600/mo". Replace with "Fixed Resource Allocation" vs "Per-Project Allocation".
*   **Events Page:** Ensure metrics focus on *Capacity Utilization* (e.g., "85% Full") rather than ticket sales revenue.

I will start by refactoring the store to use abstract "Investment" units instead of currency, then update the UI to reflect this strategic, non-monetary focus.
