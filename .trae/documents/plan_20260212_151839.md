I will build the **Club Echelon Strategy Dashboard** as a Next.js application, designed for high interactivity and visual impact.

### **Tech Stack**
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for smooth animations & "neon" vibe)
*   **Visualizations:** 
    *   `reactflow` for the interactive Node-based maps (Marketing, Strategy flows)
    *   `recharts` for the Dashboard & ROI calculators
*   **State Management:** `zustand` (to share live data/calculations between pages)
*   **Voice/Input:** Web Speech API integration for verbal commands

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture**
1.  Initialize Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.
2.  Set up the global "Nightclub" theme (Dark mode, Neon accents).
3.  Create the **Global State Store** (Zustand) to hold simulation data (Budget, # of Events, Reach, ROI).
4.  Implement the **Voice Command Hook** to listen for navigation and action triggers.

#### **Phase 2: Interactive Modules (The "Nodes")**
1.  **Marketing & Strategy Map (React Flow):** Build the interactive node graph where users can drag/expand nodes (Social Media -> Reach -> Sales).
2.  **Scenario Simulator:** Create the interactive component for Base/Intermediate/Advanced models with adjustable sliders.
3.  **Calculator Engine:** Implement the logic that updates `Projected Revenue` and `ROI` in real-time as users adjust sliders.

#### **Phase 3: Page Development**
1.  **Home:** Intro with brand vibe and high-level navigation nodes.
2.  **Marketing & Content:** Detailed node maps for strategy and content production workflows.
3.  **Events:** Event management nodes with audience simulation.
4.  **Scenarios & Dashboard:** The "Money Page" – fully interactive charts and sliders showing the financial impact of the strategy.

#### **Phase 4: UX Polish & Deployment**
1.  Ensure responsive design (graphs adapt to mobile/tablet).
2.  Add smooth transitions between pages.
3.  Verify voice commands ("Open Dashboard", "Select Advanced Scenario").
